# Project Baking Soda
The Project Baking Soda is a collection of Gerry's personal learning toy projects. Learning from the [50projects50days](https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days?tab=readme-ov-file), thank @bradtraversy for his sharing!

Through the projects, Gerry practice vanilla HTML CSS and JavaScript, preparing for front-end study.

### Why it is called the Baking Soda?
I don't know, just a thought :)
